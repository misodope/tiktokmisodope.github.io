# MisoDope's Svelte Version of misodope.com

This project is a replication of my misodope.com static website. Previously written in React, but decided to try Svelte based on it's rise in popularity.

## Developing

To get started, simply run `npm install` to install required dependencies.

Run the development server: `npm start`

## Deployment

After making changes run `npm run deploy` which will run a production build and deploy to *Github Pages*.
